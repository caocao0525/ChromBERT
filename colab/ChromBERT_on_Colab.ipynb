This tutorial introduces **ChromBERT**, a BERT-based model tailored to analyze chromatin state annotation sequences (Fig. 1). **ChromBERT** efficiently processes these sequences to identify patterns during its pretraining stage, learning general chromatin state patterns across the genome. During fine-tuning, **ChromBERT** distinguishes between promoters associated with high and low gene expression based on their distinctive patterns.\n","\n","Additionally, **ChromBERT** allows users to extract motif-like chromatin state patterns from specific regions, such as highly expressed promoters, utilizing the attention matrix from BERT training. The tool also incorporates motif clustering with Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to enhance understanding of genomic regions, potentially aiding in the discovery of novel biological functions and enriching our insights into chromatin dynamics.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","<figure>\n","<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=12OK_ZjwcjRNIlsPItRbhXy-kKGfEKqsh\" alt=\"ChromBERT Overview\" width=\"800\"/>\n","<figcaption>Fig.1 The Overview of ChromBERT</figcaption>\n","</figure>\n","\n","<br><br>\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"UBsGwJlvZ0fB"},"source":["---\n","<br>\n","\n","# Objective\n","\n","In this tutorial, we will:\n","\n","<!-- ![ChromBERT](https://img.shields.io/static/v1.svg?label=Tutorial&message=Preprocessing&color=salmon) -->\n","<!-- ![ChromBERT](https://img.shields.io/static/v1.svg?label=Tutorial&message=Preprocessing&color=salmon) -->\n","<!-- - Aim 1.
