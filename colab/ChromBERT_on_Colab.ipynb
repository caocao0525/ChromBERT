        "Chromatin states are crucial for gene regulation and cellular identity, defined by unique histone modifications. This tutorial introduces **ChromBERT**, a BERT-based model tailored to analyze chromatin state annotation sequences (Fig. 1). **ChromBERT** efficiently processes these sequences to identify patterns during its pretraining stage, learning general chromatin state patterns across the genome. During fine-tuning, **ChromBERT** distinguishes between promoters associated with high and low gene expression based on their distinctive patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, **ChromBERT** allows users to extract motif-like chromatin state patterns from specific regions, such as highly expressed promoters, utilizing the attention matrix from BERT training. The tool also incorporates motif clustering with Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to enhance understanding of genomic regions, potentially aiding in the discovery of novel biological functions and enriching our insights into chromatin dynamics.\n",

For instance, when inputting the sentence \"<u>ChromBERT heuristically reveals original motifs, BERT's epigenomic research triumph</u>\" into BERT, it is first tokenized into subwords like this:\n",

        "One of the most notable features of **ChromBERT** is its ability to detect motif-like patterns in chromatin state sequences within regions of interest. This allows for the identification of specific patterns that uniquely appear in certain classes during classification tasks by focusing on the areas with high attention scores in the attention matrix produced during the prediction process.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike static DNA sequences, chromatin state sequences can vary in position and length. **ChromBERT** addresses this with a Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) scheme to cluster the motifs with similar characteristics, providing a more consolidated insight for users."

        "Like DNA motifs in DNABERT <small>(Y. Ji, et al., 2021)</small>, chromatin state motifs in our study are identified as recurring patterns of chromatin states distinct to a certain category in binary classification. We used the same parameters as DNABERT to detect these motifs.\n",
        "\n",
        "- First, we identified regions with high attention scores from the attention matrix. We set a threshold defined as a score above the matrix's mean and more than ten times the minimum score. These high-scoring regions were considered motif candidates and further filtered using a p-value of `0.05` to confirm significant enrichment in one class.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Motifs are defined as sequences longer than four chromatin states (around `800` bps) and appear at least three times exclusively in the target class. Unlike DNA motifs, which are compared with existing libraries, our chromatin state motifs were collected without such comparisons due to the absence of a relevant library."

        " 5. Clustering Motifs: Next, we conduct clustering for the detected motifs. Initially, ChromBERT identifies motifs based on their statistical significance (p-value) without constraints on merging, capturing a comprehensive set of patterns. Using the DTW-aligned motifs, apply the agglomerative clustering algorithm. This algorithm groups similar patterns into categories by hierarchically merging data points based on their pairwise similarities\n",
